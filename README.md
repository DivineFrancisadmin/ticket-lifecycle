Intake

As I practice using the simulator, I start by ensuring tickets are correctly created. In this environment, I simulate real-world scenarios where tickets can come from various sources, such as phone calls, emails, web forms, chat apps, or in-person requests. No matter how an issue is reported in the simulator, I create a ticket to track the work, measure performance, and reinforce good habits for when I transition into a real IT setting.</p>

  Assignment and Communication
<p>

</p>
<p>
Once the ticket is created in the simulator, I assess its priority level, such as Sev-A or Sev-B, to determine how urgent it is. Then, I assign it to the appropriate department, whether itâ€™s Support, SysAdmins, or Networking, and set the correct Service Level Agreement (SLA) to establish response time expectations. Since this is a practice environment, I take the time to understand how ticket assignment and SLAs work, ensuring that I fully grasp the importance of proper categorization. The simulator helps me get used to the built-in email notification feature, which keeps users updated and allows for simulated follow-ups.
