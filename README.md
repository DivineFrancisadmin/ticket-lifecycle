Intake
<p>

To properly manage a ticket, I start by ensuring it is correctly created. In a real-world IT setting, tickets can come from various sources, such as phone calls, emails, web forms, chat apps, or even in-person requests. No matter how an issue is reported, I always create a ticket to track the work, measure performance, and ensure no request gets overlooked.

  Assignment and Communication
<p>

</p>
<p>
After the ticket is created, I assess its priority level, such as Sev-A or Sev-B, to determine how urgent it is. Then, I assign it to the appropriate department, whether itâ€™s Support, SysAdmins, or Networking, and set the correct Service Level Agreement (SLA) to establish response time expectations. Communication is key, so I make sure the assigned agent is notified and that the end-user receives updates. Since most ticketing systems, including osTicket, have an email notification feature, I rely on it to keep users informed and allow for easy follow-up.

Working the Issue
<p>

</p>
<p>
With the ticket assigned, I begin troubleshooting and working on the issue. I diagnose the problem, apply a fix, and document every step to ensure clarity for future reference. Throughout this process, I maintain clear and professional communication with the end-user, providing updates and explanations as needed. If the issue requires escalation, I transfer the ticket to a higher-level team, such as SysAdmins, and confirm that the new agent has the necessary permissions to continue working on it.

Resolution

<p></p>
Once the issue is resolved, I finalize the ticket by adding resolution notes that can be referenced later if needed. Before closing it, I notify the end-user to confirm that everything is working as expected. Even after closure, I remain aware that users can still respond via email with follow-up questions, so I ensure my documentation is thorough and my communication remains professional throughout the entire ticket lifecycle.
